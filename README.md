This is the API folder to be used in conjunction with the "moodtrace_webapp" application. This API folder does not include the node_modules folder containing the required dependencies for the project - the NPM command "npm install" can instead be used in the Terminal to generate the node_modules folder and download the packages listed in package.json with all required dependencies. Ensure that the API is running alongside the "moodtrace_webapp" application. Both should be accessible simultaneously for the web application to interact with the API endpoints.
 Once dependencies are successfully installed, start the server by running "npm start" within the terminal. The server runs on "http://localhost:3002".
