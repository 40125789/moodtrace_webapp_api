This is the API server side folder containing my SQL queries. This is to be used in conjunction with the "moodtrace_webapp" application. Create the node_modules folder by running "npm install" in the terminal, this will then install the dependencies/modules required to run the server side API. Once the node_modules folder is successfully added, run "npm start" to run the server on "http://localhost:3002".
